The plasm of “1313” swarms with an executive elite, including NML, who sit on each others boards, commissions, committees. and secretariats. Subordinate car- riers, whom “1313's” employment service places into key positions in government, carry “1313” policy into every nook and cranny of! American life and local govern mental affairs. When any “1313” policy is bein; opposed, “1313” calls out its shock troops of support. Take the case o states’ rights in “1313's” Governors Conference where, for two years, : governor from a middle westerr state has been demanding of th Conference a strong resolution ad vocating restoration of the consti- tutional balance of powers, includ- ing the return of. certain taxing powers to the sovereign states. In 1957, the GC resolutions com- mittee would not report the pro- constitutional resolution — unani- mously and the statement was bur- ied at a closed executive session of GC and hidden from public view. In 1958, the governor tricd again, proposing that GC adopt a strong resolution “to return taxing pow- ers from the federal government back to the States.” Such decen- tralization is not in accord with “metro’s” collectivistic tax policy. Needless to say, the pro-constitu- tional resolution was knocked down again in “1313's” guberna- torial locker room. When a “1313” project, such as “metro,” goes into action, the “1313” machine is kept in motion by all of its members pulling to- gether aided by contact groups such as the League of California Cities which is a member of Com- munist-linked CIMC. oO iLLusTRATE how “1313” ma- Leaves the Miami-Dade Coun- ty situation: early in 1954, The Metropolitan Miami Municipal Board, composed of well-meaning citizens, through a University of Miami professor, commissioned the university to serve as the agent in supervising a fact-finding study regarding local government which had been declared unable to meet the challenge of the changing times. The consultant contract was awarded to PAS in Chicago, leg- man of “1313.” Scant months later, the “1313” report was ready, pro- posing a “metro” city-county gov- ernmental merger of Dade Coun- ty with Miami City. Paralleling activity took place in the Florida Legislature. An amend- ment cleared the way for a charter that was under revision. Result was a “metro” charter par- alleling the PAS report which in- creased the governing body of the county from five to nine commis- sioners, five elected at large and representing no specific district. Citi- zen boards were stripped of juris- diction and demoted to advisory status. Certain elective officers were abolished, including the tax asses- sor and tax collector, to be filled by appointees. Voters approved the charter 44,- 175 to 42,448. County law became the supreme law, and the law will be enacted as ordinances of the board of county ‘commissioners. Through this power of ordinance, the board will be able to establish policy and provide standards of service over many matters before untouchable, including an unlim- ited level of services, financed by taxation levied in part by a group of nonrepresentative policy mak- ers, whom the “metro” charter moved another step farther from the electorate. County government can actually take over a municipal- ity and provide such services if a city fails to mect standards pre- scribed by the county. At present, the Miami-Dade pan- acea-to-panic = program) is being contested in the courts, where de- termined citizens are sceking re- straining orders to chain the “met- ro” leviathan that the new “metro” charter has created. Sacramento’s “mctro” merger, also vamped by “1313's” PAS, con- tains a strikingly similar pattern that abolishes clective offices and strips citizens of representauon through the technique of selecting “at large” six of an 1l-member gov- erning body. HE COMPLEX varicty of state con- ~ Becton and city and county charters personify stumbling blocks to “1313's” militant — reformists. “1313” is ruefully admitting that no immediate action can be taken upon the Sacramento proposal be- cause the plan requested cannot be attempted without a change in the California Constitution. “Metro” attempted a crash pro- gram in Los Angeles, tried to by- pass a constitutional provision, and aroused the wrath of the citizenry, who were by no means asleep. Ac- cording to California law, only a Board of Freeholders, duly elected by the people, can legally submit a revised charter to the electorate. The Los Angeles Board of Su- pervisors high-handedly appoint- ed a charter committee, ignoring the law, but public disapproval blasted the renegade charter pre- sentcd by the committee, and op- posed the enlarged “metro” 11- member governing body, power- rule by ordinance, abolishment of elective othces and the constabu- lary. and delegation of administra- ive power to an appointed county manager, Which latter position was so loosely drawn that “1313” could send one of its “metro” trainees to fill it. Americans are especially an- gered by “metro’s” proposal to deny citizens the right to elect their sheriff. Most Americans believe that the sheriff, as chief law en- forcement officer in a county, has a direct responsibility to all the peo- ple of that county. “1313” proposes abolishment. of city police forces and formation of a metropolitan police force, prefer- ably under a political appointce— the “metro” sheriff—with an area- wide centralized communications system under his control. Tradi- tionally, as at present in the U.S.A, police power is delegated by the citizenry to law enforcement ‘ofh- cers at township, hamlet, or city levels, and the police are held an- swerable to the people whom they serve and protect. “Metro” police power is diametrically opposed to the American principle of a decen- tralized police power responsible to the citizenry it serves. While usually refraining from laying a finger on American schools, “metro” encourages ac- celeration of the modern trend toward consolidation of school dis- tricts, a movement completely in accord with “metro” objectives, because “metro’s” ultimate design for schools is complete subjugation under the “metro” consolidated budget. The contemporary one-court pro- posal for the judiciary appears to be another movement paralleling “metro” policy. Vice-chairman of “1313's” Conference of Chief Jus- tices, as recently as August, 195%, asked his fellow chicf justices to join in “modernizing the Ameri- can legal system.” ne prive of “1313” to force Wi chateake in present law continues. State constitution study groups (a current LWV_ project), charter study and revision committees, and press agentry that ballyhoos various types of centralization are forms of “1313” activity that occur when “metro” sets its sieht on a target area. During such campaigns, NML’s “model” laws, state consti- tution, city and county charters are leaned upon heavily, as well as canned editorials distributed free by NML to newspaper editors. Absurdly, “1313” appears to be predicating its pro-appointed man- ager arguments upon the ridicu- lous assumption that most elected executives are stupid or unreliable while: practically all appointed ad- ininistrators are bright and hon- est. NML’s “model” state constitu- uion actually proposes an appornt- cd state manager, presumably to as- sume the responsibility of an inept governor, who, according to the same NML “model”, can delegate all administrative power to the ap- pointee. “Metro” gets a toe in the civic door by persuading a city or county to appoint managers vested with administrative power. Following this, “metro’s” political leukemia can invade the remainder of the governmental system, proposing “metro” features, promoting con- solidations, annexations, and above all—“metro” mergers. This type of action leads to shrinkage of the total of grass-root governmental units throughout the Nation. In 1957, units of government in the United States totaled 102,353, as compared to 155,116 in 1942. The average annual decrease in the last 15 years has been 2.3 per cent, and in the last five, 2.5 per cent. “Met- ro” would hurry the process. scaTrer chart of the 168-plus A metropolitan areas in the United States shows the Los An- geles-San Diego-San Bernardino patch as the geographically largest. Thickest concentration of metro- politan areas occurs on the Atlan- tic-Mississippi sector of the Nation. “Metro” mergers, not already at- tempted, are being scheduled in these and other areas, with “1313's” PAS angling for the consultant contracts, but not getting them in every instance. When such is the case, a local “1313” carrier may step forward as a volunteer consultant, perhaps a radical political scientist, an insti- tute of public administration, or a university bureau of governmen- tal research, any of which may have access to the local bin of source materials. A typical bin is the 16-volume survey of Los Angeles, conducted over a period of years under the guidance of an NML chairman stationed in California, who secured financial backing from a tax-exempt foundation. “Metro” material such as this provides the makings for a quick rehash, by PAS or any other “1313” carrier, “when a “meétro” campaign strikes town. In addition to Miami-Dade and Sacramento, PAS has served “mcet- re” promotions im northcasiern Illinois, Fairfax County, Virginia, and Jefferson Parish in Louisiana. At Nashville and Seattle, where PAS “experts” did not act as con- sultants, “metro” was voted down. Ulustrating further the complex- ity of situations possible under a “metro” invasion, is the troubled situation in Toronto, Canada. Fol- lowing establishinent of “metro,” worried Canadians, like — their American counterparts in Miami- Dade, are trying to regain control of their governmental affairs. “Metro” appeals to the populace by promising thrift, claiming that “metro” big government is frugal government because it abolishes unnecessary units of government. Actually, merging does not dimin- ish the line base of services and their cost—only cost cutting, re- trenchment, and trimming of ex- travagance and waste can do that. Even top “metro” officials admit that “metro” government actually costs more, HRINKING the number of govern- S mental units does not provide a panacea of lower taxes as the ac- tual case of the State of Nebraska shows. Nebraska leads in total number of governmental units (6,059), yet enjoys the lowest per capita state tax burden of all the states save one, and bears no long- term debt. Certain “1313” adjuncts main- tain branch offices, one in The Hague, Netherlands, another in Havana, several .in Washington, D. C.,, where federal legislation comes under the “1313” whip. In Washington, , ‘'1313’s”’ NAHRO, which is promoting “slum clearance” and community demolishment and rebuilding, has counseled with federal agencies and other policy-making bodies on questions of national and local pol- icy from 1937 up to the current year. Also, “1313's” Interstate Clear- ing House on Mental Health pro- vides impetus to the controversial mental health movement through its mechanism of propaganda, na- tionwide “studies,” and regional working arrangements with organ- izations and state agencies. “1313's” PPA (formerly Civil Service Assembly of the U.S. and Canada) conducts an annual in- ternational meeting and four an- nual regional conferences and lends a broad base of support to the professional carecrists in “1313's” mushrooming empire of public ad- ministration. Actually, it appears that after laying to rest the corrupt remains of the Tweed and Gas Rings, NML has raised from:the ashes the “1313” specter, whose “metro” threat is more terrible than anything that has risen in the past. What reasons are given for pro- moung such a form of government? Charges of “horse and buggy” have been leveled at American constitutions and charters which have been accused of inability to meet the changing times. To these claims have been added the twin bogeys of increasing population and _ population-concentration in urban areas. “1313” crowns this with the charge that present exor- bitant costs of running govern- ment ‘will soar even higher if the “metro” panacea is not accepted. Increasing population is no occa- sion for panic, nor is it an admissi- ble excuse for “metro’s” panacea- to-panic program. Needed in “metro” afflicted areas is alerted thinking to recognize “metro” policy or program wher- ever appearing, and citizen action to forestall the big “metro” inva- sion, for “1313” is on the war march for additional scalps to hang alongside Miami-Dade. Prec- edent set by any unit of American government falling before “metro,” will play squarely into the hands of those who would weaken the American Republic. Also needed is an intelligent citi- zen approach to eliminate bureau- cratic malpractices which are bur- dening Americans with unneces- sary taxation, These corrections are to be accomplished, not by chang- ing the form of government, but by changing sick administration within government. “Metro’s” pill of centralization merely makes the sick patient sicker. An answer to “metro” at its first step is a countermovement de- signed to safeguard individual American rights and to prevent the economic smothering of citizens under crushing “metro” taxation and debt. A tightening of citizen control upon public affairs through city-county separation, is one solu- tion that can be tried. City-county separation runs counter to merging and would make “metro’s” other steps difficult, perhaps impossible. From a taxpayer viewpoint, city- county separation may include the advantages of (1) abolishing the practice of county spending in un- incorporated areas part of the taxes raised from the city, (2) reducing duplication of functions performed by the two governments, (3) bring- ing government closer to the gov- erned-by-consent. Separation could cast county gov- ernment into a miniature of the ideal type of federal government— an agency restricted to handling over-all problems for which it is geographically suited, such as flood control, and forbidding it from usurping municipal servicing at the local level. The political situation would remain at home. Similar corrective steps at other governmental levels now being menaced by “metro” action or pol- icy, such as states’ rights at the federal level, would go far in re- storing government to the hands of the governed and dispel the “metro” monolithic encroachment. INALLY, a revitalization of sound economic thinking is im- perative, to redirect into American society the principles of competitive private enterprise as opposed to “metro” planned public enterprise; also a renaissance in sociopolitical thinking which could whittle bu- reaucracy down to zero size. To accomplish these ends, the American electorate must keep its hands free upon the power of the ballot. Americans have toppled in- ept public officials and will do so again, correct past mistakes, and prevent would-be tyrants from seiz- ing political and economic power.
